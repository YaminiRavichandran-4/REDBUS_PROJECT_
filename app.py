        This app allows you to search for bus routes, filter them by price, seats, and ratings,
        and get detailed information about the available buses. You can navigate through 
        different pages to find the routes, apply filters, and explore the features.Skills take away from this project are 
        Web Scraping using Selenium, Python, Streamlit , SQL. First I have done web scraping using selenium. Later applied python coding to 
        create a SQL database. And Streamlit for deploying the derived data.

                The "Redbus Data Scraping and Filtering with Streamlit Application"
                 aims to revolutionize the transportation industry by providing a comprehensive 
                 solution for collecting, analyzing, and visualizing bus travel data.
                  By utilizing Selenium for web scraping, this project automates the extraction
                   of detailed information from Redbus, including bus routes, schedules, prices, and seat availability. 
                   By streamlining data collection and providing powerful tools for data-driven decision-making,
                    this project can significantly improve operational efficiency and strategic 
                    planning in the transportation industry.
